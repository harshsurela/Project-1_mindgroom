# Project-1_mindgroom
mindgroom is a website developed in Django backend which is based on image processing.it was a freelance project. The core functionality of the application is that the raw image of the finger is captured from the mobile camera and sent to the backend. it can be seen even with human eyes. Then the admin can download those images as a zip and can send it to DMIT persons , who will analyze it and perform their prediction. After that the server process the image and optimize it so that the fingerprints on it can be seen even with human eyes. for developing this mechanism i have used OpenCv Framework and matplotlib.
